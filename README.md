# 100 Days of DevOps

This repository documents a hands-on DevOps learning journey focused on building strong foundations in Linux systems, cloud infrastructure, automation, and real-world operational workflows.

The content is written in a practical, explain-why-not-just-how style, based on completing structured hands-on challenges and applying the concepts to realistic production scenarios. 
Each note captures what was built, why it works, and what typically breaks in real environments.

While the material is cloud-agnostic, the principles apply directly to platforms like Strettch Cloud, where engineers deploy and operate Linux workloads, configure networking, automate infrastructure, and make cost-conscious architectural decisions. The goal of this repository is to help engineers move from theory to confident, real-world cloud operations.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository is best explored as a progressive learning path. Topics build from core Linux fundamentals into automation, containers, CI/CD, and cloud operations.

The notes are intentionally written to support:
- Engineers transitioning into DevOps or cloud roles
- Teams deploying workloads on Linux-based cloud platforms
- Instructors or advocates explaining infrastructure concepts to others
