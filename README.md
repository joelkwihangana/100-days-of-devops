#100 Days of DevOps

This repository is a hands-on, teaching-focused DevOps learning series designed to help engineers understand Linux systems, cloud infrastructure, automation, and real-world operational workflows.

The content is written in a practical, explain-why-not-just-how style, based on real troubleshooting experience and production support scenarios.

While the practices here are cloud-agnostic, the same principles apply directly to platforms like Strettch Cloud, where engineers deploy Linux workloads, configure networking, and automate infrastructure reliably and cost-effectively.
